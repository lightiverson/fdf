If the subject requires it, you must submit a Makefile which will compile your
source files to the required output with the flags -Wall, -Wextra and -Werror, 

use cc, and your Makefile must not relink.

Your Makefile must at least contain the rules $(NAME), all, clean, fclean and
re.

the executable file is updated from object files, which are in turn made by compiling source files.
